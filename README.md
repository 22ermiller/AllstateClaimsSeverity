# AllstateClaimsSeverity
This is a repository created for the Allstate Claims Severity kaggle competition (Link to the competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/allstate-claims-severity). I use different machine learning algorithms to predict loss for a specific claim. The ClaimsAnalysis.R file contains the 3 models explored (Penalized Regression, Random Forest, and Boosted Tree).
